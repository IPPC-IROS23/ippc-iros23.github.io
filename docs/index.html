                <h1>Abstract</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Robots capable of autonomous navigation and manipulation with advanced perception and decision-making skills offer tremendous potential to assist people with challenging and repetitive tasks in the service industry, including transportation, logistics, and healthcare. Recent advances in artificial perception enable robots to have semantic understanding and contextual awareness of their surroundings. Similarly, recent years have seen significant progress in decision-making for autonomous navigation and manipulation in complex situations. However, the gap between robot perception and decision-making remains large, as many techniques continue to rely on separation principles between perception, planning, and control. The objective of this workshop is to inspire the robotics community to pursue techniques that tightly <b>integrate perception, planning, and control</b> to achieve <b>physically and contextually safe robot navigation and manipulation</b> in real human environments. Robots sharing the same environment with people need novel semantic planning objectives that integrate perception and planning at a high level to generate contextually relevant robot behavior. At a low level, integrated perception and control require new metric and contextual safety constraints to enable physically safe and socially-aware robot behavior. Uncertainty and error quantification in learning-based perception and control is essential for safe and robust robot operation. This workshop will bring together experts from academia and industry to identify and discuss the current challenges and emerging opportunities in perception-aware robot navigation and manipulation, leading to <b>robot perception techniques that actively plan observations and interactions to acquire informative data</b> and <b>robot planning and control techniques that actively utilize geometric and semantic perceptual information in generating, executing, and adapting robot actions</b>.</p>

            <!------------------ Overview ---------------------------->
            <div class="page-header" id="topics">
                <h1>Topics of Interest</h1>
            </div>
            <p>The development of trustworthy robots that safely interact with humans and other robots requires a holistic approach that tightly integrates perception, planning, and control for robust and reliable robot autonomy. This workshop focuses on the interplay and integration of perception and action for physically and contextually safe robot navigation and manipulation around people. The objective of this workshop is to bring together experts from academia and industry to investigate the current challenges and emerging opportunities in perception-aware planning and control, and (inter)active perception for autonomous robots, due to a number of recent developments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <b>Integrating metric and semantic perception with planning:</b> Recent years have seen a rise in robots operating in human environments. Task and motion planning for complex mission execution requires new semantic planning objectives that can systematically integrate metric and semantic perceptual information in order to generate contextually appropriate robot behavior.</li>
                <li> <b>Physical and contextual safety for integrated planning and control:</b> Semantic understanding opens up new ways of integrating perception with planning and control at a low level, by defining new metric and semantic safety constraints that enable physically and contextually safe robot operation around people.</li>
                <li> <b>Uncertainty and error quantification:</b> Learning techniques for perception and control have shown impressive performance but are hindered by training-set bias and limited generalization ability. Integrating learned perception and control skills into planning requires uncertainty and error quantification of these skills. Recent research in robotics particularly focuses on planning and control under perceptual uncertainty, and active perception for uncertainty reduction.</li>

                <li> <b>Multimodal perception for planning and control:</b> While visual perception is the predominant sensing modality in robotics, recent years have seen a proliferation of other sensing modalities, including tactile, radar, and multi-spectral imaging, that can have impact on mobile navigation and manipulation. Integrating multi-modal sensing with planning and control is an important open direction.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The research topics of interest to the workshop include but are not limited to:</p>

                Through the generous support of the National Science Foundation, we are happy to announce that the workshop will be able to offer travel mini-awards to <b>U.S.-based workshop contributors</b> to partially cover travel expenses.  All workshop contributors are eligible, and are strongly encouraged to apply for a travel mini-award.  The number of mini-awards to be made available is, however, limited.  Priority will be given to workshop contributors from communities underrepresented in STEM, and/or HBCU/MSI-accredited Universities.  More information will be added soon, please stay tuned!
